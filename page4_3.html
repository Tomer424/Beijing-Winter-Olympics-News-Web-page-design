            skillfully combines the abstract slide, ice and snow sports form with calligraphy, integrates people with
            calligraphy, and integrates heaven and man; The two points below the word "winter" merge into 2022, which is
            vivid and natural. Below the logo is the five rings logo of the International Olympic Committee.
