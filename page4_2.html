         <p>On the evening of February 4, the first anniversary of the countdown to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games was
            held in the "ice cube" of the National Swimming Center. The appearance design of the torch of Beijing 2022
            Winter Olympic Games and winter Paralympic Games was officially released</p>
         <p>The "flying" shape of the torch of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games is very dynamic and dynamic. Its color
            is silver and red, symbolizing the meeting of ice and fire, flying with passion, illuminating ice and snow
            and warming the world. The torch of Beijing winter Paralympic Games is made of silver and gold, which
            symbolizes brilliance and dream and embodies the Paralympic values of "courage, determination, motivation
            and equality". The bottom circle of the torch is engraved with Braille with the full name of "Beijing 2022
            winter Paralympic Games"</p>
         <p>The overall appearance of the torch echoes the shape of the main torch tower at the opening ceremony of the
            Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. It is "bottomed" with auspicious cloud patterns, and transitions from bottom to
            top to paper-cut style snowflake patterns, rotating and rising, like ribbon dancing. When the torch is
            handed over, the top can be tightly buckled</p>
