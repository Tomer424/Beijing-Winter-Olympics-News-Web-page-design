            the mascots of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games were unveiled at the Hockey Hall of the
            national winter sports training center in Shougang Park, Shijingshan District, Beijing. The mascot Bing dwen
            dwen, Beijing Winter Olympic Games, is called "ice pier pier", which is originated from the national giant
            panda. China's traditional Shuey Rhon Rhon lantern is the symbol of the Winter Olympic Games.

            prototype. Panda image and super energy<img src="images/7.jpg" align="right" style="padding-left:16px;">The
            combination of ice crystal shell reflects the characteristics of winter ice and snow sports and modern
            science and technology. The shape of the head shell is taken from the ice and snow sports helmet and
            decorated with a color halo. It is inspired by the national speed skating Hall - "ice ribbon" of the Beijing
            Winter Olympic Games. The flowing bright color lines symbolize the track of ice and snow sports and 5g high
            technology; The heart-shaped pattern on the palm of the left hand represents the host country's warm welcome

            participating, working together and enjoying the Olympic Games</p>

            its prototype. Lanterns represent harvest, celebration, warmth and light. The wishful shape on the top
            symbolizes auspiciousness and happiness; The continuous pattern composed of peace dove and temple of heaven
            symbolizes peace and friendship and highlights the characteristics of the venue; Decorative patterns are
            integrated into Chinese traditional paper-cut art; The snow block on the face not only represents the
            meaning of "auspicious snow heralds a bumper year", but also reflects the anthropomorphic design,
            highlighting the loveliness of the mascot. The lanterns are mainly colored with "China Red", which
            exaggerates the festive atmosphere of the Chinese Spring Festival in 2022. The body emits light, which means

            fighting spirit of the mobilization of the winter Paralympic Games and the concept of the winter Paralympic
            Games to inspire the world.
