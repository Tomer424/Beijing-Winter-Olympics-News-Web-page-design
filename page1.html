         <p><b>Preparation in advance 2013.06-2014.03</b></p>
         <p>On June 6, 2013, the IOC announced the launch of the bidding process for the 24th Winter Olympic Games in
            2022. The whole bidding process includes two stages. The first stage is the registration stage. The national
            or regional Olympic Committee of the city that intends to bid can register with the IOC before November 14,
            2013. And submit the bidding documents before March 14, 2014. The IOC Executive Committee will select
            several candidate cities from the candidate cities. In the second stage, the final bid documents must be
            submitted in January 2015. The IOC expert group will then investigate the candidate cities and issue an
            evaluation report. After that, the candidate cities made a presentation to the IOC. On July 31, 2015, the
            IOC plenary session held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia will vote for the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympic
            Games.
         </p>
         <p>In order to bid for the Winter Olympics, the Chinese government will build three relatively concentrated
            venue clusters along the Beijing Zhangjiakou Yanqing line, with competition venues and non competition
            venues arranged in three regions. The Olympic central area in the north of Beijing will mainly undertake
            five ice sports of the Winter Olympic Games; Yanqing District in the northwest of Beijing will be used as an
            alpine skiing competition venue for snowmobiles, sledge events and skiing events; Zhangjiakou City, Hebei
            Province, will host all snow competitions except snowmobile, sled events and alpine skiing.
         </p>
         <p>On November 3, 2013, the Chinese Olympic Committee officially sent a letter to the International Olympic
            Committee, nominating Beijing as the bidding city for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.</p>
         <p>In January 2014, with the approval of the State Council, the bid committee for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games
            was established.</p>
         <p><b>Arduous course 2014.03-2015.01</b></p>
         <p>On March 14, 2014, the IOC announced: Beijing Zhangjiakou, China, Krakow, Poland, Oslo, Norway, Lvov,
            Ukraine, Almaty, Kazakhstan. Five cities officially bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics.</p>
         <p>On May 26, 2014, the mayor of Krakow, Poland, announced that Krakow would withdraw from the bid for the 2022
            Winter Olympic Games. In the public vote on Sunday, nearly 70% of the voters expressed opposition to the
            bid.</p>
         <p>On June 30, 2014, due to the domestic political turmoil, Lvov of Ukraine announced to withdraw from the bid.

         <p>On July 7, 2014, the International Olympic Committee announced in Lausanne, Switzerland that it had
            completed the primary election of the bid cities for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, and selected three
            candidate cities according to the rules: Beijing, China, Oslo, Norway and Almaty, Kazakhstan.</p>
         <p>On October 2, 2014, Oslo had to renounce its bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics because the Norwegian
            government voted to refuse to provide financial support. The only candidate cities left are Beijing and
            Almaty.</p>
         <p><b>Final sprint 2015.01-2015.06</b></p>
         <p>In January 2015, Beijing Winter Olympic bid committee and Almaty Winter Olympic bid committee successively
            submitted the bid report of 2022 Winter Olympic Games to the International Olympic Committee.</p>
         <p>At 4 p.m. on March 28, 2015, the IOC assessment team held a press conference at Beichen intercontinental
            hotel. Alexander Zhukov, member of the IOC and chairman of the assessment committee, and Christopher Dolby,
            executive president of the Olympic Games, attended the press conference. Zhukov said that during the
            five-day inspection, the evaluation team asked more than 150 questions and had a heated discussion with the
            Beijing Olympic bid committee. All members of the Beijing Olympic Committee are very pleased to see that
            they have fully played an important role in the International Olympic bid for the 2020 Olympic Games.
         </p>
         <p>In early June 2015, the IOC evaluation committee released the evaluation report on the candidate cities
            after on-site investigation.</p>
         <p>On June 9, 2015, Beijing and Almaty made technical presentations to IOC members at the Olympic Museum.</p>
         <p><b>Dreams Come True 2015.07</b></p>
         <p>On July 30, 2015, the 128th plenary session of the International Olympic Committee opened at the Kuala
            Lumpur Convention and Exhibition Center. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib delivered a speech and opened the
            plenary session. Liu Yandong, head of the Beijing Winter Olympics delegation and vice premier of the State
            Council, led a delegation to attend the opening ceremony. On the morning of the 31st, IOC members listened
            to the statements of Brasov (Romania), Lausanne (Switzerland), the bidding cities for the 2020 third Winter
            Youth Olympic Games, Almaty (Kazakhstan) and Beijing (China), and voted by secret ballot in the afternoon.
            Beijing won 44 of the 85 votes this time, Almaty won 40 tickets and abstained one. Beijing defeated Almaty
            with four votes. The result of Almaty's bid is similar to that of Beijing's bid for the Olympic Games in
            1993 and Pingchang's bid for the Winter Olympic Games in 2007.
